// gh5 - the skinning waits for the animation that writes its bones.
//
// GH5 skins on the CPU: the draws' constants hold no bones. The three job workers turn each model's vertices with its
// palette (sub_825535E0, the job sub_82556220: [model + 116] 4x4 matrices, [model + 120] of them, 128 on a musician, the
// pieces of a musician sharing one) into a buffer that the draw then reads. A skeleton's update has two steps:
// - sub_82478050 starts the animation jobs if this frame updates it (sub_82431F00), which write the palette in stages,
//   and sets +136.
// - sub_824767F0 queues the skinning of each piece (sub_82556348), and only then, if +136 is set, waits for those jobs
//   (sub_82567D20 on the group at 0x82E8C448 + 1160 + [+108] * 4).
// So the skinning can read a palette half written: on two runs bones 69, 97-101 and 103, the clothes' and the physics',
// were one matrix at that moment. What hangs from them shoots out for one frame, in long wedges (Gustavo: Axel Steel's
// coat, at 110, 130 and 160 FPS, on both renderers, with the Havok bodies and the animation's pose quiet). A probe
// comparing the palette as the skinning began and ended: 127 of 128 bones changed during it, 19 to 48 times a song, and
// at the very second of a stretch he noted down. It also happens at 60 FPS, fewer times; nobody saw the stretch there.
//
// Here the wait comes first, so the skinning starts on a finished palette: the race went down to 1 to 3 times a song, one
// of them as the band is placed, and Gustavo played four songs with no stretch. The game's own wait stays and finds
// nothing to wait for. Measured cost: the one frame where the whole band moves, about 30 ms to 44 in Party Play.
