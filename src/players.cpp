// gh5 - the profile follows the controller that starts the game, and each slot's kind of controller follows
// the one played.
//
// On the console the controller that presses a button at the start of the game plays with its own profile. Here there
// is one profile, the first controller's (the order Windows connected them in), and a guitar that pressed Start with a
// controller connected before it was the profile's guest. GH5 has no title screen: it starts in Party Play (the scripts'
// freeplay), songs playing while the players join. While Party Play shows for the first time (src/quit_prompt.cpp, each
// frame) the SDK's primary press window is open: the controller that presses first becomes user 0, the profile's, and
// the others are its guests ("Name (1)", the SDK's signin_guests, set in src/startup.cpp), as when guests sign in on the
// console. GH Van Halen's window lasts as long as its title screen, which any press leaves. Party Play stays after a
// press, and while the window is open every new press on another controller takes user 0, so here the first press from
// anyone closes it for good: a second player joining the song, or Party Play entered again from the main menu, moves
// nothing. A press on user 0's own controller is seen here; on another one, the SDK's read makes it user 0's, and its
// next read shows it here.
//
// The game asks a controller port for its kind (sub_82489958: a guitar, the drums, or the singer for a plain gamepad)
// only when the port's controller connects. The keyboard's pad shares slot 0 with the first controller, and the SDK
// answers for the one in the player's hands, which at the start is the controller: with a controller set to sing in
// the launcher (or a kind the game gives the vocals) and the keyboard playing guitar, the keyboard's player was the
// singer (a player's report in GH Metallica, 2026-11-02). When the SDK finds the slot played on another kind of
// controller, the port's update asks again, outside a song.
