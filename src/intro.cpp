// gh5 - the boot's intro video ended as soon as the game has loaded: Party Play right after the loading.
//
// GH Metallica's, GH Van Halen's and GH Smash Hits' boot is a chain of UI states (ui_boot.qb: a legal notice, then a
// video per state, PlayMovieAndWait each), and their fix makes the script function PlayMovie find none of those
// videos. GH5's boot is different (read from the decoded scripts): guitar_startup_spawned (scripts\guitar\guitar.qb)
// plays one video, Intro_FINALanimatic_0209 (data\movies\intro_finalanimatic_0209.bik.xen: 700 frames at 29.97 fps,
// 23.4 s, the logos and the game's intro, the same video as moviestreams\GH5_Intro.bik), as its loading screen
// (create_loading_screen {is_bink ...}), loads the game behind it, then calls destroy_loading_screen {wait_for_unload,
// wait_for_end}. With wait_for_end (passed by the boot only) destroy_loading_screen_spawned
// (scripts\guitar\menu\loading_screen.qb) shows a button helper and waits while the video plays:
//   begin  if NOT IsMoviePlaying ... break  if ($end_movie_early = 1) break  wait 1 gameframe  repeat
// the helper's handler (LoadingEndMovie, on Start or the green fret) setting end_movie_early. Then Party Play
// (UIstate_freeplay). There is no legal notice to wait for.
//
// The video cannot be refused as in those games: create_loading_screen_spawned starts it and then waits until it is
// playing (begin if IsMoviePlaying break ... repeat) before the startup goes on, so a video not found would stop the
// boot. Instead end_movie_early reads as 1 in destroy_loading_screen_spawned, as if the player pressed Start the
// moment the game had loaded: the video ends there and then, and Party Play follows. The global itself keeps its
// value. The read goes through src/debug_menu.cpp's hooks on the script interpreter (the "$name" resolve, one hook per
// address); after the first such read they are left alone again (unless the debug menu is on). If the video ends
// before the game has loaded (a slow disk), the loop ends on IsMoviePlaying and nothing changes.
