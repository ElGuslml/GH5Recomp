// gh5 - the game's post-processing effects, each of which can be turned off.
//
// The engine's screen effects (the scripts' ScreenFX_AddFXInstance and ScreenFX_UpdateFXInstanceParams; the
// instances are made by sub_824DDAB0) are created once per scene and then given new parameters by the scripts. All of
// them work on the 3D scene: the note highway and the HUD are drawn after them.
//
// GH Van Halen's composite applied six effects in one pass by a mask. GH5's, sub_82643598, has two passes of the shader
// _Uber_ScreenFX (Pass0: _motionblur1, _bloom1, _dof1, _tonemap1, _color1; Pass1: _motionblur1, _noise1, _vignette1,
// _visualizer1), chosen from a word of flags with one bit per effect type that is on (+4 of the effects manager: 0x1
// MotionBlur, 0x2 Bloom2, 0x4 Godray (the bloom's variant too), 0x8 DOF3, 0x10 Tonemap, 0x20 Bright_Sat (the color),
// 0x40 Noise2 (the grain), 0x80 Vignette, 0x100 the visualizer). The composite reads that word three times: once for
// both passes' variants and their constants, then once for each pass's way of drawing (taking the scene and
// replacing it, or blending over it). The hooks take the bits of the effects turned off out of each read: the passes
// are then the variants without them, drawn the way the remaining effects need. The word itself is left alone, so an
// effect turned back on is applied from the next frame. The passes that feed them (the bloom's and the depth of
// field's blurred copies) still run; their result is not used.
//
// GH Van Halen's ink blotches are not part of GH5's composite (InkBlotch has no bit), so GH5 has no switch for them.
